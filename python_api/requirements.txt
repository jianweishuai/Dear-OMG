# Dear-OMG Python API Requirements
# 
# This file lists the Python dependencies required for the Dear-OMG Python API.
# Install these dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: The Dear-OMG Python API is a wrapper around the native C++ executables
# and does not require heavy scientific computing libraries. The API primarily
# uses Python standard library modules for subprocess management and file operations.

# Core dependencies (Python standard library modules used):
# - os (built-in)
# - sys (built-in) 
# - subprocess (built-in)
# - json (built-in)
# - pathlib (built-in)
# - typing (built-in in Python 3.5+)

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality:
# Uncomment the following lines if you want additional features

# For better path handling (already included in Python 3.4+)
# pathlib2>=2.3.0; python_version<"3.4"

# For enhanced type checking during development
# mypy>=0.910

# For testing the API
# pytest>=6.0.0
# pytest-cov>=2.10.0

# For documentation generation
# sphinx>=4.0.0
# sphinx-rtd-theme>=0.5.0

# For code formatting and linting
# black>=21.0.0
# flake8>=3.8.0
# isort>=5.0.0

# Note: This API is designed to be lightweight and uses only Python standard library
# modules to minimize dependencies and ensure compatibility across different environments.
