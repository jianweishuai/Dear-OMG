## <p align="center">Dear-OMG: an omics-general compression method for genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data</p> 

## Introduction
- Dear-OMG, a unified, compact, flexible, and high-performance metadata storage solution. 
- Dear-OMG introduces a novel file storage structure and utilizes the Elias-Fano encoding algorithm to compress and store proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics metadata into the unified OMG format. 
- The OMG format not only demonstrates remarkably **high compression and decompression speeds**, but also **enables parallel random access** to any data block. 
- Test results reveal that, compared to the commonly used proteomics formats of mzXML and mzML, the OMG format achieves an **80% reduction in storage space**, a **90% decrease in conversion time**, and approximately a **10-fold speed improvement** with support for parallel random access.
